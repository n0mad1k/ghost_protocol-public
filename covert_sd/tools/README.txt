PORTABLE VERACRYPT - NO INSTALLATION REQUIRED!
======================================================================

Inside the "VeraCrypt" folder on this device:

• VeraCrypt-Portable-Windows.exe
    → Double-click to run on ANY Windows PC
    → Works without admin rights on most systems

• VeraCrypt-Portable-Linux.AppImage
    → Run on ANY Linux system (no install!)
    → Command: ./VeraCrypt-Portable-Linux.AppImage
    → AppImage = portable, works on all Linux distributions

• veracrypt-Ubuntu-22.04-amd64.deb
    → System-wide installer for Ubuntu/Debian
    → Install with: sudo dpkg -i veracrypt-Ubuntu-22.04-amd64.deb
    → Use this if you prefer installed version over AppImage

• VeraCrypt-MacOS.dmg
    → Install on Mac (one-time)
    → Works on any Mac after that

This means you can access your encrypted files on ANY computer
even if VeraCrypt is not installed!

======================================================================
YOUR PASSWORD
======================================================================

⚠ There is NO password recovery! If you forget it, data is GONE.

Password details:
  • Case-sensitive (Abc123 ≠ abc123)
  • Minimum 20 characters recommended
  • Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
  • Write it down and keep it SAFE (not on this device!)

If you set a PIM value:
  • Standard setup: PIM = 2000
  • Paranoid setup: PIM = 5000
  • VeraCrypt will ask for this when mounting

======================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
======================================================================

PROBLEM: "Cannot find TOOLS partition"
FIX: Ensure device is fully connected; try different USB port

PROBLEM: "Wrong password" (but you know it's correct)
FIX: Check if CAPS LOCK is on; verify PIM value

PROBLEM: "Volume already mounted"
FIX: Close any VeraCrypt windows and run:
     • Linux/Mac: sudo veracrypt -d
     • Windows: Dismount all in VeraCrypt

PROBLEM: "Permission denied" when accessing files
FIX:
     • Linux/Mac: Re-run mount script (it sets permissions)
     • Windows: Check if you ran VeraCrypt as administrator

PROBLEM: "Files appear but I can't edit them"
FIX:
     • Linux/Mac: Run: sudo chown -R $USER ~/SecureStorage
     • Windows: Right-click → Properties → Security → Edit

PROBLEM: Device not detected on Android
FIX:
     • Check USB OTG adapter is working
     • Enable "File Transfer" mode in USB settings
     • Try different OTG adapter

======================================================================
FILE LOCATIONS AFTER MOUNTING
======================================================================

Linux/Mac:     ~/SecureStorage
               (In your home folder)

======================================================================
